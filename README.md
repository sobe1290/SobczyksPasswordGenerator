# SobczyksPasswordGenerator


This is a password generator that will create a password between 8 and 128 characters long. Through a series of prompts, a user will select if they want special characters, lower case letters, upper case letters, or numbers. Upon selecting all of the criteria, the text will be presented inside of the box for the user to use. There is a try again button a user can click to reload the page.

Below is a screenshot of what the page looks like:



The password generator can also be viewed at a Github live page located at:


Below are all of the possible characters used in a password:

" ", "!" ,"#" ,"$" ,"%" ,"&" ,"'" ,"(" ,")" ,"*" ,"+" , "-",".", "/", ":",";", "<", "=", ">", "?", "@" ,"[", "]", "^", "_", "`", "{" ,"|" ,"}" ,"~","a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z","A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z","0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"


This password generator uses prompts as a method of selecting criteria, however in a future release I will be changing the prompts to buttons or sliders for criteria for password generation. I also plan on later including a field where a user can select which characters should be excluded, as their company policy might require.
